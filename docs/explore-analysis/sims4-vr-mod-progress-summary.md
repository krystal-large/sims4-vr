# Sims 4 VR Mod Development Progress Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made in developing a VR mod for The Sims 4, focusing on enhancing the existing mod's functionality and improving its compatibility with Meta Quest 2 and 3 headsets.

## Key Achievements

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Reviewed the file structure of the project, gaining insights into the organization of source code, documentation, and resources.

2. **Main Script Analysis**
   - Analyzed `main.py`, the central Python script for the Sims 4 VR mod, understanding its role in VR integration, input processing, and camera system interaction.

3. **DLL Inspection**
   - Examined `s4vrlib.dll`, crucial for VR functionality, listing exported functions and their purposes.

4. **Environment Inspection Enhancement**
   - Developed functions to log details about the Python environment and imported modules specific to The Sims 4 modding context.

5. **Decompilation Attempt**
   - Implemented a function to attempt decompilation of .pyc files stored within zip archives, addressing The Sims 4's custom module loading system.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Custom Python Environment**
   - Discovered that The Sims 4 uses a specialized Python environment, requiring adjustments to standard inspection techniques.

2. **Zip-based Module Storage**
   - Found that The Sims 4 stores Python modules in zip archives, necessitating a custom approach to access and decompile these files.

3. **Decompilation Issues**
   - Encountered difficulties with the `uncompyle6` library, requiring updates to the decompilation function to align with the current API.

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Decompilation Process**
   - Further test and refine the decompilation function to ensure it works correctly with The Sims 4's module structure.

2. **Expand Module Inspection**
   - Enhance the module inspection function to provide more detailed information about classes, functions, and their arguments.

3. **VR Integration**
   - Begin integrating VR-specific functionality, focusing on improving the user experience with Meta Quest 2 and 3 headsets.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze the current mod structure for potential performance bottlenecks, particularly in VR rendering.

5. **Documentation**
   - Continue documenting the mod's structure and functionality to facilitate future development and collaboration.

## Important Considerations

- Ensure all decompilation and inspection activities comply with The Sims 4's terms of service and modding guidelines.
- Be cautious about distributing any decompiled EA code to avoid potential copyright infringement.
- Regularly test the mod in the game environment to ensure compatibility and performance.

This summary represents the current state of the Sims 4 VR mod development project. It will be updated as the project progresses and new milestones are achieved.
