# Sims 4 VR Mod Exploration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the initial exploration of key files in the Sims 4 VR mod project. As we haven't yet examined the contents of these files, this plan is subject to change based on what we discover.

## Priority Files for Exploration

1. `/src/sims4-vr/src/main.py`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file `main.py`
   - Likely the entry point for the Python part of the mod
   - Look for: 
     - Main function or script execution point
     - Imports of other custom modules
     - Interaction with The Sims 4 game engine
     - VR-specific functionality initialization

2. `/src/vrdll/vrdll/dllmain.cpp`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Probable main file for the DLL that interacts with OpenVR
   - Investigate:
     - DLL entry point
     - OpenVR API calls
     - Camera manipulation functions
     - Interaction with the game's rendering pipeline

3. `/src/sims4-vr/src/helpers/injector.py`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Potentially handles DLL injection into The Sims 4
   - Examine:
     - DLL loading mechanisms
     - Memory manipulation techniques
     - Error handling and safety checks

4. `/src/sims4-vr/src/helpers/threedmath.py`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Likely contains 3D math operations for VR
   - Look for:
     - Vector and matrix operations
     - Quaternion calculations
     - VR-specific math utilities (e.g., lens distortion corrections)

5. `/src/vrdll/vrdll/OpenVR-DirectMode.cpp`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Probably handles direct mode VR rendering
   - Investigate:
     - OpenVR initialization
     - Rendering loop
     - Frame timing and synchronization
     - Interaction with the game's graphics API (likely DirectX)

6. `/src/sims4-vr/compile.py`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Compiles the mod and copies files to the mod directory
   - Examine:
     - Build process steps
     - Dependency management
     - Output locations and file organization

7. `/src/sims4-vr/settings.py`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Might contain important configuration settings
   - Look for:
     - VR-specific settings (e.g., IPD, FOV)
     - Performance options
     - Debug or development flags

8. `/src/vrdll/vrdll/include/OpenVR-DirectMode.h`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Header file for OpenVR direct mode implementation
   - Investigate:
     - Class and function declarations
     - OpenVR-specific structs or enums
     - Any custom types or constants

9. `/src/vrdll/vrdll/include/SurfaceQueue.h`
   - Uploaded to Claude Project as file ``
   - Potentially important for managing rendering surfaces
   - Examine:
     - Surface or texture management classes
     - Threading or synchronization mechanisms
     - Integration with the game's rendering system

10. `/src/sims4-vr/src/ctypes/` directory
    - Not yet uploaded to Claude Project
    - Crucial for interfacing between Python and the C++ DLL
    - Look for:
      - C type definitions and mappings
      - Function prototypes for DLL calls
      - Any custom type conversions or wrappers

## Exploration Process

For each file:

1. Open and read through the file to understand its overall structure and purpose.
2. Identify key functions, classes, or variables that seem central to the file's functionality.
3. Note any dependencies or imports, especially custom modules or external libraries.
4. Look for comments or docstrings that provide insights into the code's purpose or functionality.
5. Identify any areas that are unclear or might require further investigation.
6. Summarize the file's role in the overall mod structure.

## Next Steps

After exploring each file:

1. Update this plan with key findings and any changes to our understanding of the mod's structure.
2. Identify any additional files that may need to be examined based on our discoveries.
3. Note any questions or areas that require clarification or deeper investigation.
4. Begin formulating a plan for potential modifications or improvements to the mod based on our findings.

Remember, this plan is flexible and should be updated as we gain more information about the mod's structure and functionality.
