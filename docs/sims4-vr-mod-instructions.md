# The Sims 4 VR Mod Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This project aims to modify an existing VR mod for The Sims 4 to improve its functionality, particularly for use with Meta Quest 2 and 3 headsets. The main goals are to enhance the VR experience, implement better controls, and gain a deeper understanding of VR development in the context of game modding.

## Key Roles and Knowledge Domains

1. Game Modder
   - Understanding The Sims 4 modding ecosystem
   - Familiarity with common modding tools and practices

2. VR Developer
   - Knowledge of VR APIs (OpenVR/OpenXR)
   - Understanding of VR best practices and user experience

3. Python Programmer
   - Proficiency in Python programming
   - Experience with integrating Python into existing projects

4. 3D Graphics Programmer
   - Understanding of 3D rendering concepts
   - Knowledge of how to manipulate field of view and interpupillary distance

5. Input Systems Specialist
   - Experience with different controller inputs (Quest controllers, Xbox One controller)
   - Understanding of input mapping and configuration

## Project Steps

1. Analyze Existing Mod
   - Clone and examine the forked GitHub repository
   - Identify the key components and their functions
   - Document the current functionality and limitations

2. Set Up Development Environment
   - Install necessary tools and libraries for The Sims 4 modding
   - Set up a Python development environment
   - Ensure VR headsets are properly configured for development

3. Study VR Integration
   - Research OpenVR/OpenXR APIs
   - Understand how the current mod interfaces with the VR system
   - Identify areas for improvement in VR integration

4. Enhance VR Experience
   - Implement configurable settings for field of view and interpupillary distance
   - Optimize performance for smooth VR rendering
   - Improve first-person view transitions and stability

5. Implement Controller Support
   - Research input mapping for Xbox One controller
   - Develop a system for remapping controls
   - Implement and test Xbox One controller support

6. Python Integration
   - Analyze how Python is currently used in the mod
   - Identify areas where additional Python scripting can improve functionality
   - Implement new features or optimizations using Python

7. Testing and Refinement
   - Develop a testing protocol for VR functionality
   - Continuously test on both Meta Quest 2 and 3 headsets
   - Gather feedback and iterate on the implementation

8. Documentation
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the modified mod
   - Include installation instructions, usage guide, and known issues
   - Document the development process for future reference
